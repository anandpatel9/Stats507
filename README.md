One can find a notebook regarding the data cleaning of the NHANES DataSet. In this file, one can find multiple data cleaning methods. Dummy variables have been recoded for human understanding and columns have been renamed. Finally, the cleaned data files are exported as a .pkl file. 

Additionally, the original data files are available. 

A link to the file can be found below:

Finally, a folder regarding a Pandas Topic is available. In that folder, one can find the Notebook associated with the Pandas Topic along with a ReadMe. These notes explain a Pandas method. The method that I chose to investigate is pandas.query.
